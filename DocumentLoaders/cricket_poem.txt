 A Poem on Cricket 

In fields so green and skies so blue,
The game of cricket calls to you.
With bat and ball and stumps in line,
A match begins in perfect time.

The bowler charges, fierce and fast,
The batter stands, prepared at last.
A graceful swing, a thundering sound,
The ball flies high, then hits the ground.

Cheers arise from fans around,
As sixes soar and balls are found.
The fielders run with all their might,
To stop the score and win the fight.

The overs pass, the runs are tallied,
The teams both brave and well-rallied.
From test to T20, joy is clear,
For cricket brings us all good cheer.

So here’s to matches, short or long,
To victories sweet and spirits strong.
For cricket is more than just a game—
It’s heart, it’s soul, it’s passion's flame.
